I honestly lost track of this one.  I heard the song somewhere at the time, and I thought it was catchy so I wanted to map it.
I got decently far since I was playing osu! more often at the time.  I think I was influenced by the map of [*Electric Angel*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/172900#osu/417897).

Of course you can see it is the standard starter mapper map, stuck in the center, and jump-heavy patterns.
I remember thinking it would be cool if this would be the new pp map for all the DT players.  I remember thinking of Rafis at the time.

I touched some objects and habit mashed `ctrl+s` so I lost the actual date.

This is because I tried to remap it later, when I thought I was 'better' at mapping.
It was just as hard, if not moreso, since I didn't know how to map without any rhythms in the song.
