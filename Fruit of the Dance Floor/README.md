This map is fake, it's basically copied.

I really loved Nathan's map of [*Bedroom no Yume*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/453839#osu/973129), and I based this map off of that since it was another Yunomi map (great artist btw).

This map really taught be that object relations *should* exist, even if they aren't the best.
Even so, they keep the map much more together than otherwise.

And that Nathan is a genius at mapping and continues to get even better

Later rhythms in the song also taught me how rhythms can be kind of contentious to follow, depending on if you want accuracy, playability, or funness(?)

Oh yeah, and flex the hitsound muscle, because why not.
