I don't remember where I found this song from.  Probably from a random stream or that one YouTube video of this map.

I thought this song sounded cool so I tried to map it.  I remember I preferred this version over the Reol Kradness version because of the last chorus, and I refused to map the other version.

I felt I was getting slightly better with my patterns and how it feels, but I ended up giving up again.
It was too long of a song and I think I ran out of ideas.

It seems like this was the first map where I learned how to mute sliderends.  The changing SVs in the chorus portion of the map is created later and will be explained in the other GitHub folder titled *Oni Kyokan*.

This map's objects are still stuck in the center though.

Again I changed the map when I attempted to remap the song.
