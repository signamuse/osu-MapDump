I don't remember where I found this song from.  Probably from a random stream or that one YouTube video of this map.
I remember I preferred this version over the Reol Kradness version because of the last chorus, and I refused to map the other version.
I thought it sounded cool so I tried to map it.  I felt I was getting slightly better with my patterns and how it feels, but I ended up giving up again.
It was too long of a song and I think I ran out of ideas.

It seems like this was the first map where I learned how to mute sliderends.  The changing SVs in the chorus portion of the map is created later and will be explained below.
Still stuck in the center though.

Again I changed the map when I attempted to remap the song.

The remapped version includes much cleaner patterns.  I remember the pattern at 00:05:319 (1,2,1,2) - was influenced by BarkingMadDog's map of [Doki-Doki](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/575777#osu/1219148).
This version was made after I became comfortable with using the edge of the screen.  I think this was after I began to watch pishifat or something.
So I became more aware of where I was placing objects.
