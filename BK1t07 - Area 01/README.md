I think I remember watching Game Grumps' playthough (ragethrough) of Battle Kid, and I thought the song in the background of the first level was pretty good.

Either this, or another YouTuber that put chiptune songs in their stream highlights.

I thought this song was good and I wanted to map a fun version of it that I would enjoy playing.
I ended up getting pretty far in the map, but at the bridge section (?) it got too repetitive and I stopped mapping it.

This was the first time I put effort into hitsounding and I learned how many of the timing window elements and filesystem worked.

The hitsounding the way I did it was cancer and unnecessary, but it gave me joy.  I remember looking for the right chiptune sounds for the hitsounds for a while.

I was kind of proud of the improvement that I had, so this was actually the first map I uploaded to my profile, but I deleted it soon after since being a self-conscious person.

There was a period where I thought I lost the map or something when I deleted it since I have 2 versions in my game where one is at 0 stars for some reason.
