Made this map since there was no other fitting its role.  I tried to make a map that filled the gap of a lower diff *Speedrun* map (since the Akali map was too hard for me at the time).

This led me to learn more complex slider shapes and relations, especially with tech patterns and compromises between playability and what 'seems' fun.

I also learned certain repeating and changing patterns like those at 01:01:320 (1,2,3,4,1,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,1) - to show emphasis and object relations together.

I ran out of ideas at the end, so it stopped.
