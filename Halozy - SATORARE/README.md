Hey, another concept map!

I'm sad, since I actually changed the tech section in the later portion of the map to not relate objects as well as it did in the past (for some reason).
It was pretty fire.

The beginning starts with the typical map style, but now I see everything is spaced to far apart for low intensity.

The pattern at 00:20:689 (2,3,4,5,6) - is actually copied to 00:22:038 (2,3,4,5,6) - for the idea of *Recall*.
The same thing happens in the section following this, where flow only goes in a single direction and patterns are very repetitive (too much so, and not interesting enough)

I remember selecting this song since [*K.O.K.O.R.O*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/114220#osu/295915) was mapped at the time, but not this portion of the song.
