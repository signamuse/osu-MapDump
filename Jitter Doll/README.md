I picked this song for obvious reasons stated in the first mapset README (I came from Project Diva and vocaloid culture). 
I knew the mapset of [*First*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/171388#osu/467689) at the time, and I thought the song *Jitter Doll* sounded similar (it actually was the same producer).
So I thought, why that mapset and not this one? (because Teto sounds garbage unless cillia tunes her and this song is actually rather slow)

Looking back, I remembered I tried to fiddle with storyboarding since I thought it would be cool.  I obviously didn't get anywhere.

If you can tell, I took HEAVY *inspiration* from the moph mapset of [*First*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/171388#osu/467689), mostly the Fort diff.

I even saw the storyboard and wanted to do something like that *manually*.

I messed with the hitsound volumes and basic-level SVs in this diff, so it wasn't entirely a waste I guess.  Some avant-garde slider volumes tho
