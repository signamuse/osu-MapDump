# osu!MapDump
Hi, welcome to this obscure repository.  These are the short mapping snippets I have done over my years of playing the game.

Me, [kimchii42](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6551312)

I believe even people starting from extremely low skill can map good things in the end.


## Progression

This list encompasses the general process of how my mapping developed over a long time.
The chronological order of why I mapped things:
* A desire to map songs I liked/listened to at the time
* A desire to make something that I would enjoy playing
* Influenced by the mapping meta at the time (it was easier to map in a certain style, certain influences)
* There were no maps of it at the time
* Had ideas to map a song that I listened to at the time

Even if my maps are not the favorite of many or even of the best quality, I believe my maps may be worth something.

Even if I started from the worst, I believe you can improve as much as I potentially have.  Exposure and practice are the best methods of learning this in my opinion.

This is the order of when I tried to map each map.
