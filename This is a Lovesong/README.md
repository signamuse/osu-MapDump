This is definitely when I started to be influenced by handsome maps.  I liked his patterns so I used some of the elements in the intro.
I think this shows in the later part of the map with the increasing space jumps, but this is not executed well, where the first increasing spacing jumps was done as a remap.

I had a period where I really liked this song, so I put some of my ideas to the test.

This was remapped slightly, so the start of the bridge is better than later in the bridge.

Edited when I had an idea.
