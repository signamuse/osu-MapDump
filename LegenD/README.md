Here is the first map that returned to my profile.

This was the first map where I sat down and told myself that I would finish a map.  I took the assets from [Akali's mapset](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/307319#osu/687624) and got to work.

I got the concept of sliders rotating around a center slider to simulate the object at the center of the screen, but the execution wasn't really the best.
I used elements of offset symmetry and tech mapping styles from tech maps that I played at the time.

I sent this in to Kroytz's stream, and he and Priti commented on it.  The map wasn't for rank, but I thought I should get some comments on the map regardless.
This showed to help me in the long run.
