This remapped version includes much cleaner patterns than the original.

I remember the pattern at 00:05:319 (1,2,1,2) - was influenced by BarkingMadDog's map of [Doki-Doki](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/575777#osu/1219148).  I thought, since other people use it in good maps, I'm in the clear of using it for mine.

This version was made after I became comfortable with using the edge of the screen.

I think this was after I began to watch pishifat or something, so I became more aware of where I was placing objects.
