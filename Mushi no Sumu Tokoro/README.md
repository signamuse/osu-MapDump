This map I think is pretty cool.

I think I changed the mp3 so that the timing changed and later the base SV changed.  This caused some sliders to be too long for their rhythm.
I did this since I thought the sliders were too fast.

Other than that, this started my different and attemptive creative interpretation of songs.  This also started some of my binge on precision in patterns.
I think some of the ideas are cool and I really should finish the map.

I know some of the symmetric patterns are inspired from the new tech maps at the time like Lavender's [*Chrono Diver*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/510859#osu/1086050).
