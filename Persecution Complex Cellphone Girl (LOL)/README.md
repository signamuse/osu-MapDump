Here's the first one.  It's been a long time since I started trying to use the editor.

When I started osu!, I actually came from watching people play Project Diva F 2nd, so I wanted to play a rhythm game.
I came here and I was very influenced by vocaloid at the time, so when I tried mapping, I wanted to map vocaloid songs (typically Giga-P songs).

This is technically not the first, since I now remember that I started with [*Hanairo Biyori*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/143397#osu/509510) since I was searching for the english title used in the Project Diva edit (lol).  I gave up super quickly since it was a long song and it was too hard (I do remember wanting to map the little piano sounds after the end of the song tho).

It's not good, and it even looks like a first attempt.  Make what you will of it.
