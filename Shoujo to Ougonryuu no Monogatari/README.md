Fun map time!

I made this since this was my era of PP farming, I think.  I loved Lami maps since I play with mouse, and also discovered Hatsuki Yura at the time, one of my favorite artists.

This made me learn some basic patterns in 2015 style PP mapping (that really wasn't retained, I don't like mapping pp), and the final additions to sneaky hitsounding tasks.
Sadly these sneaky methods are not allowed in ranking maps as I have seen later (even though I could still argue for them imo) >:(
