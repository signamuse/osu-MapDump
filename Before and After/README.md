Stan Dreamcatcher?

I liked this song after I heard it in one of their MVs.  I mapped it with heavy influence from handsome's [*For a Dead Girl+*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/682287#osu/1442763).

It uses slight deviation in sounds to change SVs to emphasize certain sounds like claps and more smooth/harsh synth sounds.

The wavy sliders are taken directly from handsome maps.
