Oh man it's this one.

I still want to remap/actually map this one with my current style or something.
Ever since joining this game from Project Diva, this was one of my favorite Utsu-P songs.

This is actually a slightly remapped version, where some sections that look better only look that way because they are remapped.

There wasn't a good map for it and I wanted to make it.

There are some precise object shenanigans in this map (that I don't even remember what I did) but it made object placements look nice.

The frenzy section (rap?) has patterns actually inspired from Skystar maps, since that's all I was good at mapping at the time LUL

The repetition and the desire not to make this a stream map makes the song intimidating, but I am sure I will finish that in the future.

There is a version for the remap, so the original has been altered.  Those are just ideas I threw in a map since I had ideas to spice certain patterns up.
Most likely not representative of the future remap.
