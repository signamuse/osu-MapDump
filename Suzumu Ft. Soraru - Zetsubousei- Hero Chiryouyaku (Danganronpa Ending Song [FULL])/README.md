If you don't know, I like Danganronpa.  I mapped this after watching the anime of the first game (which wasn't that good).
Even so, I didn't see a full version of this song, so I tried to map it.

I think I remember this being the first time where I feel like I was improving in mapping.
Putting down the patterns at the beginning started to have relations between objects and it felt good.
Obviously, it still isn't the best, but the improvement was there.
