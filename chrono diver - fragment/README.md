And here is my introduction to tech mapping.  I loved playing Skystar maps at the time (and still do), but his maps were a major source of inspiration for my patterns here.

Again, I used my newfound skills of hitsounding in this map.  I did the whole kickslider shebang and everything.

This is also probably the first map where I used the object relations to make everything feel like it works together.
That element of course was taken straight from Skystar maps, but it worked better than if I mapped it entirely on my own.

I think I also took a lot of glances at maps, specifically Skystar's [*Chrono Diver -Pendulums- USAO Remix*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/414448#osu/925161) for slider shapes and orientations of objects.

This seems like the first partially concept-driven map, where I intended the intro to be a series of circle sliders that worked like clocks, repeating and going with the clock bell sound.

I touched this one later too since I had new ideas :(
