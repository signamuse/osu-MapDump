This map was an itch of certain songs and concepts.

I was inspired by the maps of [*Touhou Hisouten*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/455069#osu/975517) and [*Odoru Mizushibuki*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/153887), so I basically made a combination between the two.

I remember making a terrible extended hitsound version of Odoru Mizushibuki, but in retrospect, it was very garbage.

Same probably goes with the map, no pattern or feel to the rhythm, just hittin' them sounds
